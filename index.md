### Create all your redux files and starter code with a simple command ðŸ”¨
It's very annoying to create react-redux files eg: `comp.reducer.js, comp.actions.js, comp.selector.js, comp.saga.js` for each store component everytime.And all the files have same starter **code**. Though there are extensions in VSCode for started code snippet. But creating all the same files again and again and writing the same starter code is boring and waste of time ðŸ˜–. This simple shell script will help you to create your all redux files with starter code ðŸ¥³.
